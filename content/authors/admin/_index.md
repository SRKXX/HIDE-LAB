# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include the understanding of the complex reasoning and behaviour of intelligent agents (humans or machines) inside social environments like hybrid societies, where humans, machines, and everything in-between interact. Broadly, my areas of specialisation in AI include complex and adaptive multi-agent systems, agent based modelling, and neurosymbolic architectures. In particular, I am interested in the topics of deceptive AI and deception modelling, self-explainable AI agents with Theory-of-Mind, and the ability of AI agents to build stories and narratives.

interests:
  - Deceptive AI
  - Intelligence Analysis
  - Multi-Agent Systems with Self-* properties, i.e. self-adaptation, self-organisation, and self-awareness
  - Meta-Cognitive AI, i.e. AI agents with capabilites such as Reflection, Theory-of-Mind, and nested representation
  - Philosophy of AI

Stefan Sarkadi is Proleptic Lecturer & Royal Academy of Engineering Intelligence Community Research Fellow in the Department of Informatics at King's College London. He is also an Associate Researcher at Inria Sophia-Antipolis and a Faculty Affiliate in the Trustworthy AI Lab at Ontario Tech University. Stefan's research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and deception, an increasingly complex socio-cognitive phenomenon that is difficult to detect and reason about. His work tackles the integration of techniques from AI and deception analysis to generate narratives about multi-agent interactions in complex systems. The aim for this ultimately is to help intelligence analysts infer the best explanation against artificial sources.
