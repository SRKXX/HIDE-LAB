# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests include the understanding of the complex reasoning and behaviour of intelligent agents (humans or machines) inside social environments like hybrid societies, where humans, machines, and everything in-between interact. Broadly, my areas of specialisation in AI include complex and adaptive multi-agent systems, agent based modelling, and neurosymbolic architectures. In particular, I am interested in the topics of deceptive AI and deception modelling, self-explainable AI agents with Theory-of-Mind, and the ability of AI agents to build stories and narratives.

  - Complex Adaptive Systems
  - Market Modelling

My research lies at the intersection of model-based AI and Digital Twins theory, aiming to improve the safety and trustworthiness of socio-technical systems. I currently design learning and reasoning architectures for trading mechanisms operating in financial markets. I am interested in social biases and how can these generate undesired unexpected outcomes. Research interests include Machine Learning, Digital Twins and Agent-Based Modelling.
