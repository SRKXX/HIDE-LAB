<p>  The Hybrid Intelligence and Deception Exploration (HIDE) Lab focuses on understanding the complexity of human-AI interactions and deception in increasingly hybrid societies. The lab is led by <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/stefan-sarkadi"> Dr. Stefan Sarkadi</a>, who is currently a Proleptic Lecturer (Research Assistant Professor) in the Dept. of Informatics at King's College London. The Lab's aim is to act as an international hub for conducting state-of-the-art AI-based research to tackle the topic of deception.
